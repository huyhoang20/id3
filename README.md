# DecisionTreeID3

Implement ID3 algorithm for data with all categorical attributes by using panda and numpy (sklearn DecisionTreeClassifier doesn't support categorical attributes).

## Stopping criteria 
* `max_depth`:  the max depth of the tree.
* `min_samples_split`: the minimum number of samples in a split to be considered.
* `min_gain`: minimum gain for splitting.
